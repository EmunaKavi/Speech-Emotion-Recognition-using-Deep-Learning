# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-using-Deep-Learning
This is a real-time web app that detects **emotions from speech audio** using a **CNN + LSTM** model trained on the [TESS dataset](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/24487). The model is integrated into a clean Flask frontend that allows users to upload `.wav` files and receive instant emotion predictions.
